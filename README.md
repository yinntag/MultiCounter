# MultiCounter
This paper introduces the novel task of Multi-instance Repetitive Action Counting (MRAC), which aims to simultaneously detect multiple human instances, track them over time, and count the number of repetitive actions. To this end, we propose MultiCounter+, an efficient and robust deep learning framework that incorporates several key components. Specifically, MultiCounter+ first employs the mixed spatiotemporal interaction for efficient context correlation across consecutive frames. Secondly, MultiCounter+ designs task-specific heads with spatial-temporal consistency and long-short period awareness for accurate repetition counting and robust generalization to action-agnostic repetitions. Finally, we develop an MRAC dataset (MultiRep) to train MultiCounter+ and further exploit a large-scale synthetic data pre-training pipeline to strengthen model generalizability, providing a solid foundation for adaptation to diverse action patterns and human instance counts. Extensive experiments on MultiRep and existing RAC datasets demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of MultiCounter+.
